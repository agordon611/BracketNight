# Bracket Night (In progress)

Welcome to Bracket Night! This is a personal project that I came up with based on a fun, social game I found on social media. 
Each day, the website loads in a new topic/category (the default for right now is pasta). Then, a bracket is populated with 8 different
items in that category. Then the user can debate with friends as to what item is crowned the winner in that category.
